    <p>This is it. You've slaved away for an entire year, and you can now look forward to your two weeks of paid vacation. 
        Maybe you're planning to relax on a beautiful beach in Costa Rica, stroll through the streets of Paris, or party in Ibiza while drinking shots from the 6 pack of a guy named Julio. 
        But once you get there you find out that the Costa Rican beach isn't as advertised, and the crystal-clear water isn't that crystal-clear anymore now that sewage from the hotel is being pumped into it.
         Or that baguettes are overrated. Or that Julio's name is actually Julian, he's from Newcastle, and there's no room for a shot cup in a belly button full of barbecue sauce.</p>
